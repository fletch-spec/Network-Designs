## Background

Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are used for a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Building a neural network from scratch can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially for those new to machine learning. This repository aims to simplify the process by providing abstract neural network designs that can be used as a starting point for building more complex models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have a basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks. If you are new to these concepts, we recommend starting with some introductory resources before diving into the abstract neural network designs.

Once you have a basic understanding of neural networks, you can explore the repository to see the different abstract designs that are available. Each design is presented as a Python script, along with a README file that provides a brief overview of the design.

## Usage

To use one of the abstract neural network designs in your project, simply copy the relevant code into your own Python script. You can then modify the code as needed to suit your specific use case.

It's important to note that these abstract designs are not intended to be used as-is. They are meant to be modified and adapted to suit your specific needs. As such, we encourage you to experiment with the code and explore different configurations to see what works best for your application.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, we welcome pull requests that add new abstract neural network designs or improve upon existing designs. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and adheres to the Python coding standards.
